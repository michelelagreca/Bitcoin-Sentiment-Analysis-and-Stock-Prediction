# Bitcoin: Sentiment Analysis and Stock Prediction
## What is Bitcoin?
"People use different terminologies to define Bitcoin. Some people call it a cryptocurrency, while others use digital currency. Some individuals refer to Bitcoin as a virtual currency. But, all these terms are correct. That's because Bitcoin is digital money. It's a form of electronic cash or money. That means you can't have physical Bitcoins in your pocket. Ideally, Bitcoin resides in computers and mobile devices only.<br>

Bitcoin is one of the pioneer cryptocurrencies to use blockchain technology. Since the introduction of this cryptocurrency in 2009, no hacker has managed to infiltrate it. And this has proven to most investors that it's a safe investment. What's more, the meteoric rise of Bitcoin's value has captured many investors' attention.<br>

Bitcoin has also proven to be a valuable value storage asset. That's why some people compare it with gold. During an economic crisis, Bitcoin has proven its ability to withstand challenges better than fiat money. Thus, you can use this cryptocurrency to store value during a financial crisis" [1].<br>
