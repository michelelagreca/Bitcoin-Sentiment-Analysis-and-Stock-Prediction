This project was a part of the course that i followed in my Bachelor Degree of Computer Engineering with the Prof. Antonino Furnari: Social Media Management.<br><br>
In this project, the main point is the importance of Bicoin in the today's world. Particularly, the project is divided in two phase:
* A __sentiment analysis__ of tweets about Bitcoin, to make a comparison between the price and the historical data of the cryptocurrency and the general idea of people about it, taking twitter as mirror of their thoughts.
* A __stock prediction__ using Machine Learning and regression.
